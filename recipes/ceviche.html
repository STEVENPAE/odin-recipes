        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The very known <em>"Ceviche"</em> is the most famous dish in Peru and we'll teach you how to make at home!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1</strong> large stalk celery, coarsely chopped.</li>
            <li><strong>&#189; cup</strong> chopped white onion.</li>
            <li><strong>1 &#189;.</strong> kosher salt, plus more.</li>
            <li><strong>1 &#189;.</strong> peeled grated ginger.</li>
            <li><strong>&#188;.</strong> grated garlic.</li>
            <li><strong>1</strong> thick white fish fillet, bloodline removed, 1 &#189; oz. Flesh reseved for marinade.</li>
            <li><strong>2 oz.</strong> fresh lime juice</li>
            <li><strong>1</strong> small Japanese sweet potato or small sweet potato, peeled, sliced &#188;" thick Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling</li>
            <li><strong>&#188; cup</strong> red onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li><strong>1 &#188; tsp.</strong> finely chopped cilantro leaves with tender stems, patted dry.</li>
            <li><strong>1</strong> aji limo chile, seeds removed, finely chopped.</li>
            <li>Chancha, for serving.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a blender, blend celery, white onion, salt, ginger, garlic, 1 &#189; oz. fish flesh, 1 cup ice, and &#188; cup water until mostly smooth. Transfer to a large bowl or pitcher. Add lime juice; season with salt, if needed. Refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium bowl; discard solids.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat broiler to high. On a sheet pan, arrange potatoes in a single layer. Drizzle with oil, season with a pinch of salt, and toss to combine. Broil, watching closely, until fork-tender, 5 to 8 minutes. Let cool, then cut into quarters.</li>
            <li>Rinse red onion in a strainer under running water about 1 minute. Taste one slice. If onion still has a strong bite, continue to rinse until onion tastes sweet.</li>
            <li>Fill a large bowl with ice. Cut remaining fish into cubes or sashimi-like cuts. Place in prepared ice bowl, season with a pinch of salt, and mix with a spoon. Add red onion, potatoes, cilantro, and chile and toss to combine. Drizzle with 1 cup leche de tigre and toss again to combine.</li>
            <li>Arrange ceviche on chilled plate. Pour remaining leche de tigre over. Garnish with cancha.</li>
        </ol>
